## Explaining my approach
First, i thought about the UX (User eXperience). When seeing the initial page there were no navbar and no footer, so there is nothing to prove that the website is legit or to know for what company the website is for.
- I added the navbar (added the company name in the navbar at the left)
- I added the footer with newsletter subscription (we can use that for email and digital marketing) and different policies to make sure the user feels safe and continue his order in peace

Then i also noticed when scrolling the user can easily lose track of the steps
- I made the steps sticky, the user can always keep track of where he is

Also, there is not a guide for the user so it can help him choose according to his project
- I added a Skip Size guide

If the user is lost and want more infos, he has nobody, no email no contact to talk to
- I added a "contact us" section

Talking about the responsiveness of the website
- The display is responsive, so it is functional and good looking on all screens

For better enhancement of the UI i used a more attractive color and font (in my opinion)
- I used an emerald ish color and some gradient with a white background
- I used the Manrope font

## Tech stack
- [ReactJS](https://react.dev/)
  -   JavaScript library, component based for simple and maintainable code
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
  -   For the type safety of the app.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)
  -   Components ready to use for the web

Overall, i went for a simple, yet effective layout that makes the user experience better, a responsive and good looking web design
